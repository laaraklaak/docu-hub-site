        <h1 class="text-4xl font-serif font-bold text-navy mb-6">Why We Don't Accept Bags of Cash.</h1>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8 italic">Understanding the "Reimbursement Model" and why electronic transfers protect you.</p>

        <div class="prose text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-6">
            <p>At Docu-Hub, we occasionally get asked: <em>"Can I just meet you and give you the cash for my Property Tax?"</em></p>
            <p>The answer is always a polite, firm <strong>No.</strong></p>
            <p>This isn't because we are difficult. It is because we operate as a <strong>Designated Non-Financial Business (DNFBP)</strong> under Jamaican Law. Here is why our strict electronic payment policy is actually your best protection.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy mt-8 border-b border-gold/30 pb-2">1. The Anti-Money Laundering Shield (POCA)</h3>
            <p>Under the <strong>Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA)</strong>, businesses that handle large transactions are required to verify the <em>source of funds</em>. Accepting untraceable cash puts both the agency and the client at risk of scrutiny. By requiring bank transfers, we create an automatic, bank-verified audit trail that satisfies the Financial Investigations Division (FID).</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy mt-8 border-b border-gold/30 pb-2">2. The "Pass-Through" Protection</h3>
            <p>When you pay us for a service like a Passport Renewal, your money is split into two buckets (as detailed in our <a href="#terms" class="text-navy font-bold underline">Terms of Service</a>):</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Service Fee:</strong> Our revenue.</li>
                <li><strong>Statutory Disbursement:</strong> The government's money.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We treat your tax money as "Trust Funds." Electronic payments allow us to clearly separate these funds in our accounting, ensuring that 100% of the money meant for the government actually <em>goes</em> to the government.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy mt-8 border-b border-gold/30 pb-2">3. Your "Bulletproof" Receipt</h3>
            <p>Cash receipts can be lost or disputed. A bank transfer is permanent proof.</p>
            <div class="bg-navy/5 p-6 rounded-sm border-l-4 border-navy my-6">
                <h4 class="font-bold text-navy text-sm uppercase tracking-widest mb-2">The Audit Trail Guarantee</h4>
                <p class="text-sm">If a government agency ever claims you didn't pay your Fitness Fee, we can pull the exact transaction ID from our bank ledger and prove it within minutes. Cash doesn't offer that security.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="font-bold">So, while it might take an extra minute to log into your banking app, that minute buys you total security, legal compliance, and peace of mind.</p>
